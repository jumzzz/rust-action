### Regressive Thread Spawns
- In this code, we'll demostrate how spawning threads creates execution bottlenecks as we increase the number of threads along the way


### Requirement
- Command-line argument that controls the number of maximum threads and the time delay in millisecond. In this case, we can use clap.
- Code on how to spawn threads. My code that I've written on Rust-Book will be helpful with this
- We can get the result by pipelining instead of saving it directly within the code
- Use python for plotting
